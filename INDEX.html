        The Nigerian rice recipe discussed here is the classic Nigerian Jollof Rice prepared at parties. <br>
        This is the most popular Nigerian rice recipe. This is why you will always see it in parties. <br>
        It is quite easy to prepare if you follow the simple steps. <br>

        <H2>HOW TO COOK JELLOF RICE</H2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3Â¾ cups (750g) long grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>2-3 cups Tomato Stew</li>
        <li>Chicken (whole chicken, drumsticks or chicken breast)</li>
        <li>Pepper and salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>3 Knorr cubes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons thyme</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder (Nigerian curry powder)</li>
        

    </ul>

    <h3>Before you cook Jollof Rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> It is advisable to prepare tomato stew before hand and keep in the freezer.<br>
            This is so that whenever you want to cook any jollof rice related dish,<br> 
            it is just a matter of adding it to your cooking.</li> <br>
        <li>If you will use whole chicken then wash and cut it into pieces.<br>
            Cook with the thyme, Knorr cubes and 2 bulbs of onions (chopped). <br>
            The cooking time depends on the type of chicken. <br>
            The rooster or cockerel cooks much faster than the hen but <br>
            the hen is definitely tastier. When done, grill it in an oven. <br>
            You may also fry it. This is to give it a golden look which is more <br>
            presentable especially if you have guests for dinner.</li><br>
        <li>Parboil the rice using the method detailed in parboiling rice <br>
            for cooking jollof rice. Rinse the parboiled rice and put in a <br>
            sieve to drain.</li> <br>

    </ol>

    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the chicken stock and the tomato stew into a sizeable pot and leave to boil.</li> <br>
        <li>Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, salt and pepper to taste. <br>
            The water level should be the same level of the rice. <br>
            This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked.</li> <br>
        <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. <br>
            This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.</li> <br>

    </ol>

    <h4>Note</h4>
    If you parboiled the rice as described at parboiling rice for cooking jollof rice, <br>
    the rice should be done by the time the water is dry. Taste to confirm. If not, <br>
    you will need to add more water and reduce the heat to prevent burning. Keep cooking till done. <br>
    Serve with Peppered Fish, Fried Plantains, Nigerian Moi Moi, Nigerian Salad <br> <br>
